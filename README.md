## Introduction

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. This means that it is a language that extends the capabilities of JavaScript and includes additional features, such as static typing. Static typing means that TypeScript can identify and catch type errors at compile time, rather than at runtime as is the case with JavaScript. This can help to prevent bugs and make code more reliable.

### What are the advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript?
There are several advantages to using TypeScript over JavaScript, including:
Static typing: TypeScript's static type system can help to prevent bugs and make code more reliable.
Better tooling: TypeScript has a better ecosystem of tools than JavaScript, including linters, IDE support, and code completion.
More maintainable code: TypeScript-written code is generally easier to maintain than JavaScript-written code, as it is more explicit about the types of data that are being used.
Increased developer productivity: TypeScript can help to increase developer productivity by catching errors early and providing better tooling.

### Here are some examples of how TypeScript can be used:

Developing web applications: TypeScript can be used to develop web applications of all sizes, from small personal projects to large enterprise applications.
Developing mobile applications: TypeScript can be used to develop mobile applications using frameworks such as React Native and NativeScript.
Developing server-side applications: TypeScript can be used to develop server-side applications using frameworks such as Express and NestJS.
